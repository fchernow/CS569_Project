## Notes on Images ##
- Contains 3 logos- with 6 different levels of epsilon.
- 0-5 correspond to the following amount of noise: 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05. (See "Epsilon Chart.pdf" for more info).
- FOR TESTING: I may suggest using at least groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 from each logo and see if the noise is noticable to others.
